# Project Title

Object Oriented Program Game

## Getting Started
Are you ready to play the game?!?!?!  

Once you click 'Start Game' try your luck out and guess the phrase, either by pressing a key or selecting a key.  

I will give you five chances to do so before I call it quits!  

### Extras

* Added functionality that allows users to type the letter they would like instead of click.
* When on screen keyboard buttons are hovered over they will scale to 2 times their original size.

### Installing
